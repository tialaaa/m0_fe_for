# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I understand the concept of For statements - creating loops to run through code many times until you reach a specified condition - but do not yet feel comfortable with executing them. I had to rush through a lot of this assignment to get to the CFU.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was a combination of both productive and unproductive struggle. When I figured something out, it felt awesome, but I got stuck a lot. It's been a long day and my brain is fried.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Definitely need to make time to review all the For challenges more in depth.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
